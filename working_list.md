# Working List

## Current Task: Implement Hitomi Source, Faceted Search, And Mixed Media

### In Progress

### Done
- [x] Phase 7: Add targeted health/app smoke, expose Hitomi after the live gate, document current behavior, and close the plan (`./gradlew lint test :app:compileDebugAndroidTestKotlin :app:assembleDebug --rerun-tasks`: 449 tests, 0 failures, 3 opt-in live skips)
  - [x] Preserve typed artist probes, scoped autocomplete, optional trending, exact diagnostic URLs, and cancellation propagation in provider health
  - [x] Support both historical and current inverted `gg.js` shard polarity without accepting an ambiguous routing shape
  - [x] Pass strict targeted provider health with 11/11 Hitomi steps `OK`, including exact galleries and bounded WebP/MP4 ranges
  - [x] Expose Hitomi only after the health gate, then pass all 5 targeted app-smoke class tests (3 network routes plus 2 harness invariants) for Search, Creator Profile, overview mapping, media headers, cancellation, and source filtering
  - [x] Update README and AGENTS with faceted search, mixed media, Nozomi, mutable CDN, cancellation, decoder, and video-prefetch contracts
  - [x] Verify the supplied Hitomi logo remains byte-identical at SHA-256 `a970eb56124e1237e3b4ee18494f2a159e02bc0f9bcd95a910140ec8e852187d`
  - [x] Record unavailable device execution: no adb device, emulator command, or `$ANDROID_HOME/system-images`; Android instrumentation still compiles
- [x] Phase 6: Generalize the Viewer Media Overview and support animated WebP/anime video (`./gradlew :core-domain:test :core-data:test :core-sources:test :core-stubs:test :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:processDebugManifest :app:compileDebugKotlin :app:compileDebugAndroidTestKotlin :app:assembleDebug --rerun-tasks`: 435 tests, 0 failures, 2 opt-in live skips)
  - [x] Classify explicit animated images independently from videos and preserve exact ordered media indices
  - [x] Render still, animated, GIF, Ugoira, and video poster/badge tiles without overview autoplay
  - [x] Decode animated WebP natively on API 28+ and through a bounded, interruptible API 26/27 fallback
  - [x] Decode Hitomi WebP overview posters as separately cached static first frames on every API
  - [x] Cache only complete videos up to 16 MiB and leave large/partial MP4s on Media3 ranged streaming
  - [x] Preserve selected gallery page index/count and save Hitomi anime once as MP4 with source headers
  - [x] Compile the generated two-frame WebP instrumentation test; runtime execution remains unavailable because no adb device, emulator command, or Android system image is installed
- [x] Phase 5: Add creator browsing, typed post actions, and Hitomi deep links (`./gradlew :core-domain:test :core-data:test :core-sources:test :core-stubs:test :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:processDebugManifest :app:compileDebugKotlin --rerun-tasks`: 421 tests, 0 failures, 2 opt-in live skips)
  - [x] Delegate paginated Hitomi Creator Profile streams to exact typed artist search and preserve every distinct valid artist
  - [x] Share one canonical Unicode-safe Hitomi artist identity contract across provider metadata, persistence-facing UI admission, and deep links
  - [x] Preserve exact post taxonomy through Search, Viewer, Codex, and Creator actions without widening favorites/recommendations beyond general tags
  - [x] Switch source mode only when a source-owned post term requires it, and leave unavailable-source actions visibly unchanged
  - [x] Route Hitomi reader, gallery, anime, CG, and artist HTTP/HTTPS links for both supported hosts
- [x] Phase 4: Implement and audit Hitomi search, pagination, hydration, and media URL resolution behind the release exposure gate (`./gradlew :core-domain:test :core-data:test :core-sources:test :core-stubs:test :app:testDebugUnitTest`: 400 tests, 0 failures, 2 opt-in live skips)
  - [x] Make Random source-wide with one bounded snapshot, v2 fingerprinted tokens, bounded LRU continuity, and changed-snapshot fail-closed behavior
  - [x] Reject candidate-less/empty galleries and type every bounded Nozomi/CDN failure while preserving per-gallery isolation
  - [x] Connect exact-404 one-refresh CDN recovery to Search and Viewer through a generic source capability
  - [x] Register the real adapter while keeping `exposedRealSources()` closed until Phase 7
  - [x] Add exact Nozomi range paging, faceted include/exclude compilation, bounded hydration, and sparse Search cards
  - [x] Resolve ordered galleries, animated-page metadata, anime MP4s, and mutable AVIF/WebP/original CDN candidates
  - [x] Migrate upgraded settings once and preserve later user source-disable choices
  - [x] Copy `/Users/axel/Downloads/hitomi-logo.png` byte-for-byte into the source chip asset
- [x] Phase 3: Build reusable scoped autocomplete for NHentai and the Search UI (`./gradlew :core-sources:test :app:testDebugUnitTest`: 288 tests, 0 failures, 2 opt-in live skips)
  - [x] Add source-owned scope selection, typed suggestion actions/chips, raw prefix parsing, and Unified-mode protection
  - [x] Make NHentai compile typed facets while preserving language, full-color, direct-ID, and same-name Tag/Artist behavior
  - [x] Migrate suggestion caching to source + facet + namespace + normalized-value identity
  - [x] Keep recommendations and seen-tag learning general-tag-only while preserving Pixiv's native raw-tag preference
- [x] Phase 2: Add typed query/post taxonomy, safe legacy persistence, portable Codex snapshots, and Unified facet boundaries (`./gradlew :core-domain:test :core-data:test :core-sources:test :app:testDebugUnitTest`: 483 tests, 0 failures, 4 opt-in live skips); commit `067da0f`
  - [x] 2.1 Add canonical domain terms, typed suggestions, post taxonomy, and facet-aware query hashing
  - [x] 2.2 Add backward-compatible query/post/recents persistence records and malformed-record recovery
  - [x] 2.3 Preserve typed post snapshots through Codex share/import and offline fallback without exporting local paths
  - [x] 2.4 Migrate app/source query writers, close combined-review findings, and verify the integrated phase
- [x] Phase 1: Freeze Hitomi protocol fixtures and add binary HTTP primitives (`./gradlew :core-sources:test`: 100 tests, 0 failures); commit `0724ced`
- [x] Read `.docs/PLANS.md`, the active Hitomi ExecPlan, repository guidance, and orchestration skills
- [x] Confirm the implementation worktree is clean before phase edits (`git status --short --branch`)
- [x] Verify the new HTML ExecPlan structure, required sections, links, and diff (`npx --yes html-validate`, required-section scan, `git diff --check`)
- [x] Write the Hitomi source, faceted-search, creator, and mixed-media ExecPlan from live route evidence
- [x] Confirm the agreed UX direction and inspect the current query, suggestion, creator, source, and Viewer boundaries
- [x] Create the current-task checklist without removing historical work
